# vivahit

In this repository, I have created a web app using React that shows a list of games.

- I have fetched the list of games from a network api `https://www.mmobomb.com/api`.
- Each game shows title, thumbnail, genre, platform and release date.
- I have implemented filter games by platform (pc, browser or all).
- I have also implemented local search based on the title of the game which allows user to input a text and show filtered results based on substring matches.

To run the app, first of all, clone this github repository by running the following command
```
git clone https://github.com/rjvkr2021/vivahit.git
```
Then, change the directory by running the following command
```
cd vivahit
```
Finally, run the following command
```
npm start
```
The app will open automatically in your browser. If the app didn't open automatically, open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload automatically when you make changes.
